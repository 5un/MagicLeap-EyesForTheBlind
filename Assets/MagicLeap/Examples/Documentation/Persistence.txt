# Example Scene: Persistence

This example shows how you can bind dynamic content to the real world and persist them between
device reboots. The dynamic content are represented by orange balls with blue insides. They are
created, by bumper press, and restored, at application start up. If it fails to be created or
restored, it destroys itself and will not be restored again.

Before running the example, wait for the device to properly localize or map your surroundings. This is
confirmed by the pop-up "Landscape Recognized".

The origin is represented by a box with an animated axis inside. This is where you had last regained
your headpose. This could be where your device booted or where you started a new session after losing
your headpose.

The PCFs are indicated by a small red-green-blue axis with a status text below it. A status of "Good"
means it loaded properly and its transform is reliable. A status of "Lost" means that it used to be "Good"
but its transform is no longer reliable. This can occur when losing headpose. A status of "Regained" means
that it used to be "Lost" and has now found its correct transform. A status of "Updated" means the PCF's
transform has been changed (relative to the origin but still respects the position and orientation in the
real world).

PCFs are generated by the underlying system while mapping out your surroundings. There should always be
at least 1 PCF. If you see 0 PCFs, it means that you have not successfully mapped your surroundings. Exit
the example and walk and look around your area for a while before restarting the example. PCFs cannot be
created or destroyed by the app.

Although this example lets you create as many objects as you like, the cost of saving an association between
a virtual object and neighboring PCF is not small. It's recommended that you do this for a few (anchor) objects
in your scene and put most of the other objects under it.
